! NOTE: the provided code will only work on the arduino IDE and not on vs code
! ENSURE THE COMPONENTS ARE CONNECTED PROPERLY AND DOUBLE CHECK THE CODE

* Description: 
--> This project finds the distance of an object, and lights 
up some lights based of how close an object is to the HC-SR04 module
and makes some noise with the active buzzer. Similar to how a car alerts the driver 
when they are in close proximity to another surface of vehicle to alert them of a danger.

* Components:
- breadboard
- arduino uno r3
- 4 220 ohm resistors
- 4 5mm red leds
- 1 active buzzer
- 1 HC-SR04 -> ultrasonic ranging module

* Steps:
- figure it out
- search camera roll at that date and you might find a video for reference
- code is attached
